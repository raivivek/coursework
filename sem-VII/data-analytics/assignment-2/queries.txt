! Creating the table

CREATE TABLE passengers (
    class INT,
    survived BOOL,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    sex ENUM('male', 'female'),
    age INT,
    sibsp INT,
    parch INT,
    ticket VARCHAR(255),
    fare FLOAT,
    cabin VARCHAR(127),
    embarked CHAR,
    boat VARCHAR(10),
    body INT,
    destination VARCHAR(255),
    PRIMARY KEY (name, ticket)
);

! View schema

DESCRIBE passengers;

! Import data

LOAD DATA INFILE '/var/tmp/titanic.csv' INTO TABLE passengers
TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
IGNORE 1 LINES;

! Observations

Total people = 1309
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers;
=> 1309

Female = 466
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers WHERE sex='f';
=> 466

Male = 843
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers WHERE sex='m';
=> 843

* Women were more likely to be saved in Titanic disaster

    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers WHERE sex='f' AND survived=1
    => 399
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers WHERE sex='m' AND survived=1
    => 161

    That is, 86% female vs 19% male survived. Interestingly, the
    ratio of male to female before boarding was 1.85 which reduced
    to 0.40 in survivors.

* While it may seem that this undue bias of saving females over male
  should not reflect among the children, an analysis of the data suggests
  that this bias prevailed even with the kids younger than 10 years.

    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers WHERE age < 10;
    => 345
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers WHERE age < 10 AND sex = 'm';
    => 228
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers WHERE age < 10 AND sex = 'f';
    => 117
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers WHERE age < 10 AND survived = 1;
    => 123
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers WHERE sex='f' AND age < 10 AND survived=1;
    => 72
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers WHERE sex='m' AND age < 10 AND survived=1;
    => 58

* Women with sibling/spouse were as likely to die in the disaster as those
  who did not have any spouse/sibling.

    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers WHERE sex='f' and sibsp > 0;
    => 204
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers WHERE sex='f' and sibsp = 0;
    => 262
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers WHERE sex='f' and sibsp = 0 and survived = 1;
    => 197

    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers WHERE sex='f' and sibsp > 0 and survived = 1;
    => 142

    On doing a Chi-square goodness of fit test with null hypothesis that both
    are equally like to die, we safely say (with significant statistical
    confidence) that having a spouse or sibling did was independent to getting
    saved.

* An interesting analysis will be to observe the distribution of survivors across
  different classes of people that boarded Titanic.

    SELECT class, COUNT(*) FROM passengers GROUP BY class;
    =>
    +-------+----------+
    | class | COUNT(*) |
    +-------+----------+
    |     1 |      323 |
    |     2 |      277 |
    |     3 |      709 |
    +-------+----------+
    SELECT class, survived, COUNT(*) FROM passengers GROUP BY class, survived HAVING survived = 1;
    =>
    +-------+----------+----------+
    | class | survived | COUNT(*) |
    +-------+----------+----------+
    |     1 |        1 |      200 |
    |     2 |        1 |      119 |
    |     3 |        1 |      181 |
    +-------+----------+----------+
    SELECT class, survived, COUNT(*) FROM passengers GROUP BY class, survived HAVING survived = 0;
    =>
    +-------+----------+----------+
    | class | survived | COUNT(*) |
    +-------+----------+----------+
    |     1 |        0 |      123 |
    |     2 |        0 |      158 |
    |     3 |        0 |      528 |
    +-------+----------+----------+

    Clearly, we can see that traveling as a boarder of third class category,
    one had a reduced likelihood of survival in the disaster. A further gender
    analysis can be done on the three classes as well.

* We can also try to see if age had any role to play in likelihood of survival.
  That is, more younger people were saved than older people. This is intuitive because
  it's a popular philosophical problem of saving a young life versus an old life
  and in an isolated experiment, people are more likely to save a younger person
  than older one. However, several factors like wealth, class can also affect this.

  A good way to examine this is to obtain obtain the number of people boarded
  versus survived for every age and examine any significant shift in the mean.

  Relevant queries are:

    SELECT age, COUNT(*) FROM passengers GROUP BY age;

    SELECT age, survived, COUNT(*) FROM passengers GROUP BY age HAVING survived = 1;
