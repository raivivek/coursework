Phylogeny?
==========

The study of evolutionary relationship.

All the organisms on earth have descended from a common
ancestor, which means that set of species, extant or extinct,
is related.

This relationship is Phylogeny, and the study of existing
organisms' morphological, physiological, and molecular characteristics
to create a tree -- is called Phylogenetics.

Molecular Phylogenetics uses the structure and function of the molecule
and how they change over the time to infer relationships.

Phylogenetic analysis is the process of testing hypotheses about the
descent of species from a common ancestor.

The null hypothesis in most cases is that the organisms have a common
ancestor (it is because it is natural to accept the fact that any two
organism must have been related)

16s rRNA Analysis to determine the relationship of an unknown sequence.

We get the unknown sequence and BLAST it against three databases (NCBI,
RDP, Ez Taxon). We take the first five results from all three blasts
and put it in single file. We also add a sequence from Archeabacteria
to act as a negative control.

We then use MEGA to generate tree.
