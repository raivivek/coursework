      "The file format initially used by the PDB was called the PDB file format. This original format was restricted by the width of computer punch cards to 80 characters per line. Around 1996, the \"macromolecular Crystallographic Information file\" format, mmCIF, started to be phased in. An XML version of this format, called PDBML, was described in 2005. The structure files can be downloaded in any of these three formats. In fact, individual files are easily downloaded into graphics packages using web addresses:\n",
      "\n",
      "* For PDB format files, use, e.g., http://www.pdb.org/pdb/files/4hhb.pdb.gz or http://pdbe.org/download/4hhb\n",
      "* For PDBML (XML) files, use, e.g., http://www.pdb.org/pdb/files/4hhb.xml.gz or http://pdbe.org/pdbml/4hhb\n",
      "\n",
      "The **4hhb** is the PDB identifier. Each structure published in PDB receives a four-character alphanumeric identifier, its PDB ID. (This cannot be used as an identifier for biomolecules, because often several structures for the same molecule\u2014in different environments or conformations\u2014are contained in PDB with different PDB IDs.) The exact format of the PDB file format is contained in the latest version 3.0 maintained by the wwPDB consortium.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Example\n",
      "PDB format consists of lines of information in a text file. Each line of information in the file is called a *record*. A PDB file generally contains several different types of records, arranged in a specific order to describe a structure. A typical example of a PDB file is shown below. The description of the keywords follows in the next section. "
